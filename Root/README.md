# Three.js Journey 

This learning journey through [three.js journey](https://threejs-journey.xyz/) is to support my progression with a React project in progress [WaxOn](https://github.com/bullhornfixie/wax-on).

Three.js is vast and enables you to build stunning 3D websites. The course starts by learning all the basics, such as creating a scene, adding objects, choosing the right materials, adding textures and animating everything. 

Then, you are taken through many traditional skills such as creating your own geometries, adding lights and shadows, interacting with 3D objects and adding particles.
