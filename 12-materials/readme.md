# 12 Materials 

## Key Learning Points 
- Materials are used to put a color on each visible pixel of the geometries 
- Since the 125th version of Three.js there is no need to include `buffer` in `PlaneBufferGeometry`
- Now just `PlaneGeometry`
- matcaps 
- Adding lights
- Using differnt materials
- `meshLambertMaterial` reacts to light
- `new THREE.PlaneGeometry(1, 1, 100, 100)` // (width, height, subdivision, subdivision)
- PointsMaterial to create particles
- Environment maps + CubeTextureLoader

## Normals
- Lighting 
- Reflection 
- Refraction
