# 11 - Textures

# Key Learning Points 
- Textures (especially metalness and the roughness) follow the PBR principles
- Physically Based Rendering(PBR)
- new THREE textureLoader.load()
- UV wrapping is like unwrapping an origami or candy wrap to create a 2D plane (flat surface)
- `console.log(geometry.attributes.uv)` gives the verticies in a Float32 array of the material texture which wraps 3D object 
- Vector2 is 2D x and y axes 
- Vector3 is 3D x, y and z axes
